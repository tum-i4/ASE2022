- setting: Configure RemoteFX
  description: This policy setting allows you to control the availability of RemoteFX
    on both a Remote Desktop Virtualization Host (RD Virtualization Host) server and
    a Remote Desktop Session Host (RD Session Host) server. When deployed on an RD
    Virtualization Host server, RemoteFX delivers a rich user experience by rendering
    content on the server by using graphics processing units (GPUs). By default, RemoteFX
    for RD Virtualization Host uses server-side GPUs to deliver a rich user experience
    over LAN connections and RDP 7.1. When deployed on an RD Session Host server,
    RemoteFX delivers a rich user experience by using a hardware-accelerated compression
    scheme. If you enable this policy setting, RemoteFX will be used to deliver a
    rich user experience over LAN connections and RDP 7.1. If you disable this policy
    setting, RemoteFX will be disabled. If you do not configure this policy setting,
    the default behavior will be used. By default, RemoteFX for RD Virtualization
    Host is enabled and RemoteFX for RD Session Host is disabled.

  description: This setting sets the seed server for the global cloud to a specified

    resolution of a name to an IPv6 address and port number. The protocol, in some
    cases, requires a seed server from which to get bootstrapped. Any node running
    peer to peer can be used as a seed server. No configuration is needed for the
    seed server itself. This setting provides the added flexibility of allowing your
    users to use their peer-to-peer applications at home as well. Here are the four
    ways in which you can use this setting to control the seed server used in your
    corporation. 1. In order to use the global, well known seed server on the Internet
    only; enable the setting, leave the seed server list empty, leave the checkbox
    unchecked. 2. In order to use a corporate seed server only, enable the setting;
    insert the fully qualified domain name or IPv6 address of the corporate seed server;
    and check the checkbox. Using the corporate seed server only will prevent your
    mobile users from being able to use their peer to peer applications at home. 3.
    In order to use a corporate seed server and the global seed server, enable the
    setting; insert the fully qualified domain name or IPv6 address of the corporate
    seed server, leave the checkbox unchecked. This is the setting which will allow
    your mobile users to use peer to peer applications at both work and home seamlessly.
    4. In order to not use any seed server, enable the setting; do not insert a seed
    server name; and check the check box. If this setting is disabled or not configured,
    the protocol will revert to using a public registry key to determine the seed
    server to bootstrap from.

    by Group Policy. Windows Defender Firewall uses two program exception lists: one
    is defined by Group Policy settings and the other is defined by the Windows Defender
    Firewall component in Control Panel. If you enable this policy setting, you can
    view and change the program exceptions list defined by Group Policy. If you add
    a program to this list and set its status to Enabled, that program can receive
    unsolicited incoming messages on any port that it asks Windows Defender Firewall
    to open, even if that port is blocked by another policy setting, such as the "Windows
    Defender Firewall: Define inbound port exceptions" policy setting. To view the
    program list, enable the policy setting and then click the Show button. To add
    a program, enable the policy setting, note the syntax, click the Show button.
    In the Show Contents dialog box type a definition string that uses the syntax
    format. To remove a program, click its definition, and then press the DELETE key.
    To edit a definition, remove the current definition from the list and add a new
    one with different parameters. To allow administrators to add programs to the
    local program exceptions list that is defined by the Windows Defender Firewall
    component in Control Panel, also enable the "Windows Defender Firewall: Allow
    local program exceptions" policy setting. If you disable this policy setting,
    the program exceptions list defined by Group Policy is deleted. If a local program
    exceptions list exists, it is ignored unless you enable the "Windows Defender
    Firewall: Allow local program exceptions" policy setting. If you do not configure
    this policy setting, Windows Defender Firewall uses only the local program exceptions
    list that administrators define by using the Windows Defender Firewall component
    in Control Panel. Note: If you type an invalid definition string, Windows Defender
    Firewall adds it to the list without checking for errors. This allows you to add
    programs that you have not installed yet, but be aware that you can accidentally
    create multiple entries for the same program with conflicting Scope or Status
    values. Scope parameters are combined for multiple entries. Note: If you set the
    Status parameter of a definition string to "disabled," Windows Defender Firewall
    ignores port requests made by that program and ignores other definitions that
    set the Status of that program to "enabled." Therefore, if you set the Status
    to "disabled," you prevent administrators from allowing the program to ask Windows
    Defender Firewall to open additional ports. However, even if the Status is "disabled,"
    the program can still receive unsolicited incoming messages through a port if
    another policy setting opens that port. Note: Windows Defender Firewall opens
    ports for the program only when the program is running and "listening" for incoming
    messages. If the program is not running, or is running but not listening for those
    messages, Windows Defender Firewall does not open its ports.'

- setting: Network\Offline Files\Configure slow-link mode
  description: This policy setting controls the network latency and throughput thresholds
    that will cause a client computers to transition files and folders that are already
    available offline to the slow-link mode so that the user's access to this data
    is not degraded due to network slowness. When Offline Files is operating in the
    slow-link mode, all network file requests are satisfied from the Offline Files
    cache. This is similar to a user working offline. If you enable this policy setting,
    Offline Files uses the slow-link mode if the network throughput between the client
    and the server is below (slower than) the Throughput threshold parameter, or if
    the round-trip network latency is above (slower than) the Latency threshold parameter.
    You can configure the slow-link mode by specifying threshold values for Throughput
    (in bits per second) and/or Latency (in milliseconds) for specific UNC paths.
    We recommend that you always specify a value for Latency, since the round-trip
    network latency detection is faster. You can use wildcard characters (*) for specifying
    UNC paths. If you do not specify a Latency or Throughput value, computers running
    Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 will not use the slow-link mode. If you do
    not configure this policy setting, computers running Windows Vista or Windows
    Server 2008 will not transition a shared folder to the slow-link mode. Computers
    running Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2 will use the default latency value
    of 80 milliseconds when transitioning a folder to the slow-link mode. Computers
    running Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012 will use the default latency value of
    35 milliseconds when transitioning a folder to the slow-link mode. To avoid extra
    charges on cell phone or broadband plans, it may be necessary to configure the
    latency threshold to be lower than the round-trip network latency. In Windows
    Vista or Windows Server 2008, once transitioned to slow-link mode, users will
    continue to operate in slow-link mode until the user clicks the Work Online button
    on the toolbar in Windows Explorer. Data will only be synchronized to the server
    if the user manually initiates synchronization by using Sync Center. In Windows
    7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012, when operating in
    slow-link mode Offline Files synchronizes the user's files in the background at
    regular intervals, or as configured by the "Configure Background Sync" policy.
    While in slow-link mode, Windows periodically checks the connection to the folder
    and brings the folder back online if network speeds improve. In Windows 8 or Windows
    Server 2012, set the Latency threshold to 1ms to keep users always working offline
    in slow-link mode. If you disable this policy setting, computers will not use

    Windows reads from the cached copy after verifying its integrity. This improves
    end-user response times and decreases bandwidth consumption over WAN links. The
    cached files are temporary and are not available to the user when offline. The
    cached files are not kept in sync with the version on the server, and the most
    current version from the server is always available for subsequent reads. This
    policy setting is triggered by the configured round trip network latency value.
    We recommend using this policy  setting when the network connection to the server

    of the network above which files should be transparently cached in the Offline
    Files cache. If the round trip latency of the network is less than 60ms, reads
    to remote files will not be cached. If you enable this policy setting, transparent

    drive hosting the Offline Files cache, and that drive is the system drive, the
    total size limit is automatically adjusted downward to 75 percent of the size

    amount of space currently used by the Offline Files cache, the total size limit
    is automatically adjusted upward to the amount of space currently used by offline

    printers in Active Directory automatically, by default, the system never prunes
    their printer objects.             You can enable this setting to change the default
    behavior. To use this setting, select one of the following options from the "Prune
    non-republishing printers" box:             --  "Never" specifies that printer
    objects that are not automatically republished are never pruned. "Never" is the
    default.             --  "Only if Print Server is found" prunes printer objects
    that are not automatically republished only when the print server responds, but
    the printer is unavailable.             --  "Whenever printer is not found" prunes
    printer objects that are not automatically republished whenever the host computer
    does not respond, just as it does with Windows 2000 printers.             Note:
    This setting applies to printers published by using Active Directory Users and
    Computers or Pubprn.vbs. It does not apply to printers published by using Printers
    in Control Panel.             Tip: If you disable automatic pruning, remember
    to delete printer objects manually whenever you remove a printer or print server.'

- setting: System\Group Policy\Configure Group Policy Caching
  description: This policy setting allows you to configure Group Policy caching behavior.         If
    you enable or do not configure this policy setting, Group Policy caches policy
    information after every background processing session. This cache saves applicable
    GPOs and the settings contained within them. When Group Policy runs in synchronous
    foreground mode, it refers to this cache, which enables it to run faster. When
    the cache is read, Group Policy attempts to contact a logon domain controller
    to determine the link speed. When Group Policy runs in background mode or asynchronous
    foreground mode, it continues to download the latest version of the policy information,
    and it uses a bandwidth estimate to determine slow link thresholds. (See the “Configure
    Group Policy Slow Link Detection” policy setting to configure asynchronous foreground
    behavior.)         The slow link value that is defined in this policy setting
    determines how long Group Policy will wait for a response from the domain controller
    before reporting the link speed as slow. The default is 500 milliseconds.         The
    timeout value that is defined in this policy setting determines how long Group
    Policy will wait for a response from the domain controller before determining
    that there is no network connectivity. This stops the current Group Policy processing.
    Group Policy will run in the background the next time a connection to a domain
    controller is established. Setting this value too high might result in longer
    waits for the user at boot or logon. The default is 5000 milliseconds.         If
    you disable this policy setting, the Group Policy client will not cache applicable
    GPOs or settings that are contained within the GPOs. When Group Policy runs synchronously,
    it downloads the latest version of the policy from the network and uses bandwidth
    estimates to determine slow link thresholds. (See the “Configure Group Policy
    Slow Link Detection” policy setting to configure asynchronous foreground behavior.)

    domain name is known, the algorithm then uses NetBIOS-based discovery as a fallback
    mechanism. NetBIOS-based discovery uses a WINS server and mailslot messages but
    does not use site information. Hence it does not ensure that clients will discover
    the closest DC. It also allows a hub-site client to discover a branch-site DC
    even if the branch-site DC only registers site-specific DNS records (as recommended).
    For these reasons, NetBIOS-based discovery is not recommended. Note that this

  description: This policy setting determines the interval for when a Force Rediscovery
    is carried out by DC Locator. The Domain Controller Locator (DC Locator) service
    is used by clients to find domain controllers for their Active Directory domain.
    When DC Locator finds a domain controller, it caches domain controllers to improve
    the efficiency of the location algorithm. As long as the cached domain controller
    meets the requirements and is running, DC Locator will continue to return it.
    If a new domain controller is introduced, existing clients will only discover
    it when a Force Rediscovery is carried out by DC Locator. To adapt to changes
    in network conditions DC Locator will by default carry out a Force Rediscovery
    according to a specific time interval and maintain efficient load-balancing of
    clients across all available domain controllers in all domains or forests. The
    default time interval for Force Rediscovery by DC Locator is 12 hours. Force Rediscovery
    can also be triggered if a call to DC Locator uses the DS_FORCE_REDISCOVERY flag.
    Rediscovery resets the timer on the cached domain controller entries. If you enable
    this policy setting, DC Locator on the machine will carry out Force Rediscovery
    periodically according to the configured time interval. The minimum time interval
    is 3600 seconds (1 hour) to avoid excessive network traffic from rediscovery.
    The maximum allowed time interval is 4294967200 seconds, while any value greater
    than 4294967 seconds (~49 days) will be treated as infinity. If you disable this
    policy setting, Force Rediscovery will be used by default for the machine at every

    IPv6 DC address. The returned IPv6 DC address may not be correctly handled by
    some of the existing applications. So this policy is provided to support such
    scenarios. By default, DC Locator APIs can return IPv4/IPv6 DC address. But if
    some applications are broken due to the returned IPv6 DC address, this policy

    Windows will block the specified commands from being sent to the TPM on the computer.
    TPM commands are referenced by a command number. For example, command number 129
    is TPM_OwnerReadInternalPub, and command number 170 is TPM_FieldUpgrade. To find
    the command number associated with each TPM command with TPM 1.2, run "tpm.msc"
    and navigate to the "Command Management" section. If you disable or do not configure
    this policy setting, only those TPM commands specified through the default or
    local lists may be blocked by Windows. The default list of blocked TPM commands
    is pre-configured by Windows. You can view the default list by running "tpm.msc",
    navigating to the "Command Management" section, and making visible the "On Default
    Block List" column. The local list of blocked TPM commands is configured outside
    of Group Policy by running "tpm.msc" or through scripting against the Win32_Tpm
    interface. See related policy settings to enforce or ignore the default and local
    lists of blocked TPM commands.

    if the TPM is “Ready, with reduced functionality”. The prompt to clear the TPM
    will start occurring after the next reboot, upon user login only if the logged

    dismissed, but will reappear after every reboot and login until the policy is
    disabled or until the TPM is in a Ready state.

    effect only if a) the TPM was originally prepared using a version of Windows after
    Windows 10 Version 1607 and b) the System has a TPM 2.0. Note that enabling this
    policy will only take effect after the TPM maintenance task runs (which typically
    happens after a system restart). Once this policy has been enabled on a system
    and has taken effect (after a system restart), disabling it will have no impact
    and the system's TPM will remain configured using the legacy Dictionary Attack
    Prevention parameters, regardless of the value of this group policy. The only
    way for the disabled setting of this policy to take effect on a system where it
    was once enabled is to a) disable it from group policy and b)clear the TPM on
    the system.

    commands to the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) that require authorization. This
    setting helps administrators prevent the TPM hardware from entering a lockout
    mode because it slows the speed standard users can send commands requiring authorization
    to the TPM. An authorization failure occurs each time a standard user sends a
    command to the TPM and receives an error response indicating an authorization
    failure occurred. Authorization failures older than the duration are ignored.
    For each standard user two thresholds apply. Exceeding either threshold will prevent
    the standard user from sending a command to the TPM that requires authorization.
    This value is the maximum number of authorization failures each standard user
    may have before the user is not allowed to send commands requiring authorization
    to the TPM. The Standard User Lockout Total Threshold value is the maximum total
    number of authorization failures all standard users may have before all standard
    users are not allowed to send commands requiring authorization to the TPM. The
    TPM is designed to protect itself against password guessing attacks by entering
    a hardware lockout mode when it receives too many commands with an incorrect authorization
    value. When the TPM enters a lockout mode it is global for all users including
    administrators and Windows features like BitLocker Drive Encryption. The number
    of authorization failures a TPM allows and how long it stays locked out vary by
    TPM manufacturer. Some TPMs may enter lockout mode for successively longer periods
    of time with fewer authorization failures depending on past failures. Some TPMs
    may require a system restart to exit the lockout mode. Other TPMs may require
    the system to be on so enough clock cycles elapse before the TPM exits the lockout
    mode. An administrator with the TPM owner password may fully reset the TPM's hardware
    lockout logic using the TPM Management Console (tpm.msc). Each time an administrator
    resets the TPM's hardware lockout logic all prior standard user TPM authorization
    failures are ignored; allowing standard users to use the TPM normally again immediately.
    If this value is not configured, a default value of 4 is used. A value of zero
    means the OS will not allow standard users to send commands to the TPM which may
    cause an authorization failure.

  description: This policy setting prevents ActiveX controls from running in Protected

    installed that is not compatible with Enhanced Protected Mode and a website attempts
    to load the control, Internet Explorer notifies the user and gives the option
    to run the website in regular Protected Mode. This policy setting disables this

    Protected Mode provides additional protection against malicious websites by using
    64-bit processes on 64-bit versions of Windows. For computers running at least
    Windows 8, Enhanced Protected Mode also limits the locations Internet Explorer
    can read from in the registry and the file system. When Enhanced Protected Mode
    is enabled, and a user encounters a website that attempts to load an ActiveX control
    that is not compatible with Enhanced Protected Mode, Internet Explorer notifies
    the user and gives the option to disable Enhanced Protected Mode for that particular
    website. If you enable this policy setting, Internet Explorer will not give the

    password to query users for user IDs and passwords. After a user is queried, these
    values can be used silently for the remainder of the session. Automatic logon
    only in Intranet zone to query users for user IDs and passwords in other zones.
    After a user is queried, these values can be used silently for the remainder of
    the session. Automatic logon with current user name and password to attempt logon
    using Windows NT Challenge Response (also known as NTLM authentication). If Windows
    NT Challenge Response is supported by the server, the logon uses the user's network
    user name and password for logon. If Windows NT Challenge Response is not supported
    by the server, the user is queried to provide the user name and password. If you
    disable this policy setting, logon is set to Automatic logon only in Intranet
    zone. If you do not configure this policy setting, logon is set to Automatic logon
    only in Intranet zone.

    for each of these zones through other policy settings, and their default settings
    are: Trusted Sites zone (Low template), Intranet zone (Medium-Low template), Internet

    Valuename – A host for an intranet site, or a fully qualified domain name for
    other sites. The valuename may also include a specific protocol. For example,
    if you enter http://www.contoso.com as the valuename, other protocols are not

    that site, including http, https, ftp, and so on. The site may also be expressed
    as an IP address (e.g., 127.0.0.1) or range (e.g., 127.0.0.1-10). To avoid creating
    conflicting policies, do not include additional characters after the domain such
    as trailing slashes or URL path. For example, policy settings for www.contoso.com

    If you select High, the audio will be sent without any compression and with minimum
    latency. This requires a large amount of bandwidth. If you select Medium, the
    audio will be sent with some compression and with minimum latency as determined
    by the codec that is being used. If you select Dynamic, the audio will be sent
    with a level of compression that is determined by the bandwidth of the remote
    connection. The audio playback quality that you specify on the remote computer
    by using this policy setting is the maximum quality that can be used for a Remote
    Desktop Services session, regardless of the audio playback quality configured
    on the client computer.  For example, if the audio playback quality configured

- setting: Windows Components\Windows Installer\Prohibit removal of updates
  description: This policy setting controls the ability for users or administrators

    can still remove an update that is no longer applicable to the product. If you
    disable or do not configure this policy setting, a user can remove an update from
    the computer only if the user has been granted privileges to remove the update.
    This can depend on whether the user is an administrator, whether "Disable Windows

    If you enable this policy setting, Windows Installer is prevented from recording
    the original state of the system and sequence of changes it makes during installation.
    It also prevents Windows Installer from retaining files it intends to delete later.
    As a result, Windows Installer cannot restore the computer to its original state
    if the installation does not complete. This policy setting is designed to reduce
    the amount of temporary disk space required to install programs. Also, it prevents
    malicious users from interrupting an installation to gather data about the internal
    state of the computer or to search secure system files. However, because an incomplete
    installation can render the system or a program inoperable, do not use this policy
    setting unless it is essential. This policy setting appears in the Computer Configuration

    list in the Windows Installer dialog box is disabled. As a result, users must
    select an installation file source from the "Use features from" list that the
    system administrator configures.         This policy setting applies even when
    the installation is running in the user's security context.         If you disable

    a program during installation. If you enable this policy setting, the transform
    file is saved in a secure location on the user's computer. If you do not configure
    this policy setting on Windows Server 2003, Windows Installer requires the transform
    file in order to repeat an installation in which the transform file was used,
    therefore, the user must be using the same computer or be connected to the original
    or identical media to reinstall, remove, or repair the installation. This policy
    setting is designed for enterprises to prevent unauthorized or malicious editing
    of transform files. If you disable this policy setting, Windows Installer stores
    transform files in the Application Data directory in the user's profile. If you
    do not configure this policy setting on Windows 2000 Professional, Windows XP

    \ the same server. An optional server name value can be specified to configure\
    \ Windows Update Agent to download updates from an alternate download server instead\
    \ of the intranet update service.         If the status is set to Enabled, the\
    \ Automatic Updates client connects to the specified intranet Microsoft update\
    \ service (or alternate download server), instead of Windows Update, to search\
    \ for and download updates. Enabling this setting means that end users in your\
    \ organization don't have to go through a firewall to get updates, and it gives\
    \ you the opportunity to test updates before deploying them.         If the status\
    \ is set to Disabled or Not Configured, and if Automatic Updates is not disabled\
    \ by policy or user preference, the Automatic Updates client connects directly\
    \ to the Windows Update site on the Internet.         The alternate download server\
    \ configures the Windows Update Agent to download files from an alternative download\
    \ server instead of the intranet update service.         The option to download\
    \ files with missing Urls allows content to be downloaded from the Alternate Download\
    \ Server when there are no download Urls for files in the update metadata. This\
    \ option should only be used when the intranet update service does not provide\
    \ download Urls in the update metadata for files which are present on the alternate\
    \ download server.         Note: If the \"Configure Automatic Updates\" policy\
    \ is disabled, then this policy has no effect.         Note: If the \"Alternate\
    \ Download Server\" is not set, it will use the intranet update service by default\
    \ to download updates.         Note: The option to \"Download files with no Url...\"\
    \ is only used if the \"Alternate Download Server\" is set.         Note: This\
    \ policy is not supported on Windows RT. Setting this policy will not have any\
    \ effect on Windows RT PCs."

- setting: Windows Components\Windows Update\Turn on Software Notifications
  description: This policy setting allows you to control whether users see detailed
    enhanced notification messages about featured software from the Microsoft Update
    service. Enhanced notification messages convey the value and promote the installation
    and use of optional software. This policy setting is intended for use in loosely
    managed environments in which you allow the end user access to the Microsoft Update
    service. If you enable this policy setting, a notification message will appear
    on the user's computer when featured software is available. The user can click
    the notification to open the Windows Update Application and get more information
    about the software or install it. The user can also click "Close this message"
    or "Show me later" to defer the notification as appropriate. In Windows 7, this
    policy setting will only control detailed notifications for optional applications.
    In Windows Vista, this policy setting controls detailed notifications for optional
    applications and updates. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting,
    Windows 7 users will not be offered detailed notification messages for optional
    applications, and Windows Vista users will not be offered detailed notification
    messages for optional applications or updates. By default, this policy setting
    is disabled. If you are not using the Microsoft Update service, then the Software
    Notifications policy setting has no effect. If the "Configure Automatic Updates"
    policy setting is disabled or is not configured, then the Software Notifications
    policy setting has no effect.

    of users when this value is set.
