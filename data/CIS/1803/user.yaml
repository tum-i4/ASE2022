    and Windows XP Professional in the Windows Virtual DOS Machine program. VDM simulates
    a 16-bit environment, complete with the DLLs required by 16-bit programs. By default,
    all 16-bit programs run as threads in a single, shared VDM process. As such, they
    share the memory space allocated to the VDM process and cannot run simultaneously.
    Enabling this setting adds a check box to the Run dialog box, giving users the
    option of running a 16-bit program in its own dedicated NTVDM process. The additional
    check box is enabled only when a user enters a 16-bit program in the Run dialog
    box.

    \ updated when users log on. By default, user Group Policy is updated in the background\
    \ every 90 minutes, with a random offset of 0 to 30 minutes. If you enable this\
    \ setting, you can specify an update rate from 0 to 64,800 minutes (45 days).\
    \ If you select 0 minutes, the computer tries to update user Group Policy every\
    \ 7 seconds. However, because updates might interfere with users' work and increase\
    \ network traffic, very short update intervals are not appropriate for most installations.\
    \ If you disable this setting, user Group Policy is updated every 90 minutes (the\
    \ default). To specify that Group Policy for users should never be updated while\
    \ the computer is in use, select the \"Turn off background refresh of Group Policy\"\
    \ setting. This setting also lets you specify how much the actual update interval\
    \ varies. To prevent clients with the same update interval from requesting updates\
    \ simultaneously, the system varies the update interval for each client by a random\
    \ number of minutes. The number you type in the random time box sets the upper\
    \ limit for the range of variance. For example, if you type 30 minutes, the system\
    \ selects a variance of 0 to 30 minutes. Typing a large number establishes a broad\
    \ range and makes it less likely that client requests overlap. However, updates\
    \ might be delayed significantly. Important: If the \"Turn off background refresh\
    \ of Group Policy\" setting is enabled, this setting is ignored. Note: This setting\
    \ establishes the update rate for user Group Policies. To set an update rate for\

    a program. This setting suppresses the "Install Program As Other User" dialog
    box for local and network installations. This dialog box, which prompts the current
    user for the user name and password of an administrator, appears when users who
    are not administrators try to install programs locally on their computers. This
    setting allows administrators who have logged on as regular users to install programs
    without logging off and logging on again using their administrator credentials.
    Many programs can be installed only by an administrator. If you enable this setting
    and a user does not have sufficient permissions to install a program, the installation
    continues with the current user's logon credentials. As a result, the installation
    might fail, or it might complete but not include all features. Or, it might appear
    to complete successfully, but the installed program might not operate correctly.
    If you disable this setting or do not configure it, the "Install Program As Other
    User" dialog box appears whenever users install programs locally on the computer.
    By default, users are not prompted for alternate logon credentials when installing
    programs from a network share. If enabled, this setting overrides the "Request
    credentials for network installations" setting.

    file in the current target path, then, by default, it searches for the target
    in the original path. If the shortcut has been copied to a different computer,
    the original path might lead to a network computer, including external resources,
    such as an Internet server. If you enable this policy setting, Windows only searches
    the current target path. It does not search for the original path even when it
    cannot find the target file in the current target path. If you disable or do not

    cannot find the target file in the current target path.

  description: This policy setting allows you to manage whether a user may preview

    Explorer. While this policy setting usually applies to items returned by OpenSearch
    queries using Search Connectors (which allow rich searching of remote sources
    from within the File Explorer), it might affect other items as well that are marked
    from this zone. For example, some application-specific items such as MAPI (Messaging
    Application Programming Interface) items that are returned as search results in
    File Explorer will be affected. MAPI items reside in the Internet zone, so disabling
    this policy for the Internet zone will prevent the previewing of these items in
    File Explorer. For the case of custom thumbnails, it is the zone of the thumbnail
    that is checked, not the zone of item.  Typically these are the same but a source
    is able to define a specific location of a thumbnail that is different than the
    location of the item. If you enable this policy setting, users can preview items
    and get custom thumbnails from OpenSearch query results in this zone using File
    Explorer. If you disable this policy setting, users will be prevented from previewing
    items and get custom thumbnails from OpenSearch query results in this zone using

    \ This is the default value. You can disable the sync provider on computers that\
    \ never go offline and are always connected to the settings storage location.\n\
    When SyncMethod is set to “None,” the UE-V Agent uses no sync provider. Settings\
    \ are written directly to the settings storage location rather than being cached\
    \ to sync later. \nSet SyncMethod to “External” when an external synchronization\
    \ engine is being deployed for settings sync. This could use OneDrive, Work Folders,\
    \ SharePoint or any other engine that uses a local folder to synchronize data\
    \ between users’ computers. In this mode, UE-V writes settings data to the local\
    \ folder specified in the settings storage path. These settings are then synchronized\
    \ to other computers by an external synchronization engine. UE-V has no control\
    \ over this synchronization. It only reads and writes the settings data when the\
    \ normal UE-V triggers take place.\nWith notifications enabled, UE-V users receive\

  description: 'This policy setting allows you to turn on logging for Windows PowerShell
    modules.         If you enable this policy setting, pipeline execution events
    for members of the specified modules are recorded in the Windows PowerShell log
    in Event Viewer. Enabling this policy setting for a module is equivalent to setting
    the LogPipelineExecutionDetails property of the module to True.         If you
    disable this policy setting, logging of execution events is disabled for all Windows
    PowerShell modules. Disabling this policy setting for a module is equivalent to
    setting the LogPipelineExecutionDetails property of the module to False.         If
    this policy setting is not configured, the LogPipelineExecutionDetails property
    of a module or snap-in determines whether the execution events of a module or
    snap-in are logged. By default, the LogPipelineExecutionDetails property of all
    modules and snap-ins is set to False.         To add modules and snap-ins to the
    policy setting list, click Show, and then type the module names in the list. The
    modules and snap-ins in the list must be installed on the computer.         Note:
    This policy setting exists under both Computer Configuration and User Configuration
